\section{Inspired by this paper, can yout think up another research question? }
"In how far will machines occupy people's jobs in industry in 2030?"

\section{Briefly introduce your model. What data do you need for it?}

Machines instead of people, this development has already started slowly. A few years ago, you knew the hundreds, thousands of stock traders - those were the ones who waved paper, they do not exist anymore. And this because of the technology and digitalization, which is developing faster and faster and therefore just replacing people.

The use of robots and other technologies will make millions of workers around the world redundant over the coming years. This is the result of a calculation of the economists of the bank ING-Diba. Accordingly, the accelerating pace of technologization threatens more than half of all jobs in Germany in the medium and long term. Of the 30.9 million social security and marginally employed people included in the survey, 18 million would be replaced by machinery and software over the coming years and decades.

Data that is needed: Data from the different areas of industry, where more and more machines are used instead of or instead of people. You can see how fast this is happening in the various industrial companies, or what the trend looks like, and use this data to calculate how it will look in 2030.
