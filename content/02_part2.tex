\chapter{What is a computer premium?}
As a computer premium it is meant, that people who are using computers at work have a higher salary than workers who are not using pcs at work. You can say that the salary difference between a pc job and a non pc job is called "computer premium". This phenomenon was clearly seen at the beginning of the introduction of computers to the offices. 

\section{How to find it out with regression method?}
With the help of a regression model, it is clear to see that computers effects the salary in a positiv way. If you create a dependency between computer usage and the salary you can see as a result that computers have an positiv effect on the wages, while other variables like gender or years of education have an minimal effect on the salary.\\


\section{Why is the
computer premium in Table II column (1) higher than that of (2) and (3)?}
While in column one, we only used one independently variable (Uses computer at work), we used in column two and three much more variables. For this reason the effect of the usage of computers on the salary in column one is much higher as it is in column two and three. \\
Column two and three has other variables in the model like "years of education", "part-time", "gender" which effects the dependent variable also. Especially "years of education" can increase its effect with each year the worker has studied.
