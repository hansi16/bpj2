\chapter{Regression models take a semi-logarithmic form}

In my opinion the main reason why the regression models have a semi-logarithmic form is, that the importance of computer skills became more and more important and so the earning for computer-skilled people increased over the years.\\
When they started to analyze the difference between computer workers and non computer workers, the usage of computers was in 1984 not so important as it is now respectively as it was in 1989. Especially in the early years of pc usage in the office rather high qualified jobs were using a computer. Not all jobs were effected by the launch of computers in the business world, so these jobs were not effected by computers and the wage of those workers stayed the same, while on the other hand the salary of computer effected jobs increased. \\
After the first stage of the introduction of pcs into the offices and the creation of newly high paid jobs, the job market calmed down and the salary for a computer skilled employee had reached a constant level.\\
